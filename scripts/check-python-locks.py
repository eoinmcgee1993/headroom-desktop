"""Every hard dependency of the pinned headroom-ai must be pinned in each lock.

The headroom-ai wheel is installed with `--no-deps` (tool_manager.rs), so pip
never resolves its dependencies: the per-platform lock file is the only thing
that puts them in the venv. A dep missing from a lock is therefore not a soft
resolve pip can fix at install time, it is an ImportError the moment the
backend starts. That is how pyyaml, added to headroom-ai's core requires_dist,
shipped missing from the Linux lock for two releases.

Checks names only, not version ranges: the pins are chosen by hand per platform
and deliberately differ, but a name that is absent is always a bug.
