//! Zero-savings canary.
//!
//! The 2026-08-21 Codex CLI 0.149.0 regression (tools moved out of the
//! top-level `tools` array into `additional_tools` input items) ran 7+ peak
//! hours before a human spotted it on the admin page. Nothing errored:
//! requests forwarded and streamed normally, they just compressed to exactly
//! zero. Every alarm we had was error-based or fleet-aggregated, and the
//! server-side per-client rate canary that looks like the obvious answer
//! cannot see it - codex is almost never a user's only client, so its
//! dominant-client cohort was n=1 on the day of the incident.
//!
//! The signature is local and per-request: a large request that ran through
//! the compression pipeline and saved nothing. This module reads it off the
//! `/transformations/feed` batch `run_activity_observation` already polls, and
//! reports once per process to Sentry, where events aggregate across the
//! fleet on a fixed fingerprint. One machine reporting is a lead; a hundred
//! is a graph.
//!
//! `detect_basis_violation` is the second canary here, for the opposite
//! failure: savings that are too LARGE to be true. See its banner.

// ── Savings-basis canary ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every input-savings percentage the app shows divides compression savings by
// the new input those savings came out of (the INVARIANT banner on
// `parse_headroom_stats_from_json` in state.rs). That only means anything
// while the numerator is a SUBSET of the denominator. Savings taken off
// content that never entered as new input have nothing to divide by, so they
// push the rate toward 100% instead of measuring anything.
//
// It stopped holding on the OpenAI `/v1/responses` path. Codex re-sends the
// whole transcript every turn and the router recompresses all of it, so the
// same removed history is booked again on every turn while the denominator
// counts only what newly reached the provider. Measured 2026-09-08 across one
// machine's retained proxy logs: gpt/codex models reported 8.10M compression
// savings against 3.90M new input (2.1x, an impossible share, displayed as
// 67.5%), where Claude reported 4.18M against 43.3M -- its frozen cached
// prefix keeps removals inside new content, which is why its rate is honest.
// The fleet reads the same: codex-dominant user-days at 26.3%, claude-code at
// 4.0%.
//
// Repairing the numerator is upstream work in the router, which is the only
// layer that knows whether a removal is first-time or a re-run of one it
// already counted. This is the tripwire for the class: savings that outrun
// the new input they are divided by cannot mean what the label says, and we
// want to know which machines and how many.
//
// ponytail: machine-level, not per-provider. `/stats` breaks new input out by
// provider but never breaks savings out, so a mixed machine whose codex slice
// is inflated can still average under the threshold and stay quiet -- it fires
// on the codex-dominant machines, which is where the displayed number is most
// wrong (71 users / 150 user-days in the 21 days to 2026-09-08). Make it

// Python cannot preempt an executor thread, so when one compression outruns

// arms a timeout-debt quarantine: EVERY subsequent compression raises
// `CompressionQuarantinedError` until that worker exits or

// 41 tokens) starved 125 of 2,336 requests -- 5.35% forwarded uncompressed,
// silently, since a quarantined request still succeeds.
//
// This reads the backend's own counters off `/metrics` rather than inferring
// the condition, and reports once per process on the fixed fingerprint the
// other two use: one machine is a lead, a hundred is a graph. It exists to
// answer whether the 5.35% is one host or the fleet, and goes quiet on its own
